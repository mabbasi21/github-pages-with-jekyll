I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about why you are awesome. 

Awesome people are usually awesome. But at the same time, they are also you. For those reasons, you are the epitome of awesome, and I hope you continue what you are doing since your awesomeness simply cannot stop since you can't either. I can tell that since you read past the first sentence, you have that drive. Keep that going forward.

Okay, enough motivational speech since I need a 100 on this project hahahaha.
